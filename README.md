Customizing Coffee Orders

A popular coffee shop, "Brewtiful," wants a flexible way to calculate the cost and list the ingredients of customized coffee orders. Customers can choose a basic coffee type, and then add various toppings or flavor shots. The system must allow for any combination of additions.

Key Requirements
Core Component: A basic coffee (e.g., Espresso, Black Coffee) with a base cost.

Dynamic Enhancements: Additions like Milk, Sugar, Caramel Syrup, or Whipped Cream must be applied on top of the basic coffee.

Combinability: Customers should be able to combine multiple additions (e.g., an Espresso with Milk and Caramel).

Interface Consistency: All components (basic coffee and additions) should share a common interface so that additions can wrap other additions or the base coffee.
